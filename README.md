# Exploratoy Data Analysis---Los-Angeles-Crime-Data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

EDA requires knowledge of statistics, visualization techniques and data-analysis tools like numpy, pandas, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib.
## Introduction:
In this project we will perform Explanatory Data Analysis on Crime taking place in the City of Los Angeles dating back from year 2010 to 2022.

We will explore the relationships between various parameters using graphs like barplot, scatter plot, etc.

## Steps to follow:
* Downloading the dataset & install all required libraries
* Explore & clean the data.
* Visualization
* Summarize & conclude
* Future Work.
